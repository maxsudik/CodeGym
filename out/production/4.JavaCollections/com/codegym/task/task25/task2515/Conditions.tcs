Make width and height bigger and you can play!
Enjoy the game :)


Требования:
1.	Relax and enjoy.


Space (part 18)


We need to finish the draw() method.
We&#39;ll do something similar with the move method. I&#39;ll write it myself today.



Space (part 18)


And a little bit more:

Implement the createUfo() method:
If the list of UFOs is empty, create a ship in the center at the top of the screen.

Implement the checkBombs() method:
You need to check whether a bomb collided with the ship.
If there was a collision, then the ship and the bomb die: call the die() method.
A bomb also dies if it moves beyond the limits of the screen (y &gt; height).

Implement the checkRockets() method:
You need to check whether a rocket collided with a UFO.
If there was a collision, then the rocket and the UFO die: call the die() method.
A rocket also dies if it moves beyond the limits of the screen (y &lt; 0).

Implement the removeDead() method:
This method should remove all dead objects (isAlive() == false) from the ufos, rockets, and bombs lists.



Space (part 18)


We still have to finish the Space class.

Implement the getAllItems method:
The method should return one common list of all BaseObject objects.

Implement the moveAllItems method:
The method should move all the objects all at the same time.
Here&#39;s what we need:
a) get a list of all BaseObjects;
b) call the move() method on each of them.



Space (part 18)


Now write the Ufo class.
It&#39;s a bit more complicated than the Bomb class and simpler than Spaceship.
You will need draw(), move(), and fire() methods.
Also, don&#39;t forget about the constructor. The parameters are doubles, and UFO&#39;s radius will be equal to 3.

We&#39;ll implement the draw() method by analogy with Spaceship. We&#39;ll use &#39;U&#39; to draw UFOs.
Add a matrix by analogy with Spaceship.

You need to implement the move() method as follows:
a) the UFO moves randomly;
Hint:
double dx = Math.random() * 2 - 1;  // -1..1
double dy = Math.random() * 2 - 1;  // -1..1
b) the UFO does not move into the bottom half of the screen;
y &lt;= height/2
c) the UFO has a 10% chance of shooting (calling the fire method).

The fire() method:
The UFO drops the bomb from its center.
Implement it by analogy with the Spaceship class.



Space (part 18)


We now turn to the draw and move methods.
In the move() method, you need to:
a) increase x by dx;
b) check to see whether the ship has moved beyond the boundaries of outer space [0, Space.game.getWidth()]. Use the checkBorders method.
Bear in mind that the ship&#39;s width is equal to twice its radius.

I&#39;ll implement the draw method myself: just declare an empty method.

We also need a fire() method, since our ship can shoot.
This method is called when we need to fire a shot.
In this method, you need to:
a) create two rockets;
b) set their coordinates equal to the left and right edges of the ship (the guns are located a distance of 2 from the center of the ship);
c) add these rockets to the list of rockets in the game object.

You can get it as follows:
Space.game.getRockets()
