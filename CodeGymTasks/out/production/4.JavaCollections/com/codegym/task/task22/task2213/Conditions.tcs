I&#39;ve corrected the code a little bit.
But overall, well done.
Enjoy playing Tetris!
P.S.
Just don&#39;t forget to adjust the height of the console.


Требования:
1.	Your big task for Level 32 is done!


Tetris (part 17)


Write your own implementation of the left(), right(), up(), and down() methods in the GamePiece class.
What do you think these methods should do?



Tetris (part 17)


Implement the step() method in the Tetris class.
This method should drop the game piece down by one step.

If the game piece cannot be placed in the new location, then:
a) put it back (bring it back up)
b) land it (the game piece &quot;lands&quot;)
c) delete all full lines in the field object
d) create a new game piece to replace the previous one.



Tetris (part 17)


Implement the removeFullLines() method in the Field class.
Here&#39;s what we need to do:
a) delete all lines from the matrix that are completely full (consist of only ones);
b) move the remaining lines down;
c) create new lines to replace missing ones.

IMPORTANT!
matrix[y][x] contains the element with coordinates (x, y).
matrix[i] contains the i-th line.
We can:
a) remove a line:
matrix[i] = null;

b) copy a reference to a line:
matrix[i+1] = matrix[i];

c) create a new line:
matrix[i] = new int[width];



Tetris (part 17)


Now we&#39;ll start to implement the methods we&#39;ve created.
Implement the print() method in the Field class
a) The method should display a rectangle of &#39;.&#39; characters and &#39;X&#39; characters.
b) The rectangle&#39;s height is equal to height, and its width is equal to width
c) If a cell is empty, display a period. If it is not empty, display the English letter &#39;X&#39;.

Hint:
if (matrix[y][x]==0) ...



Tetris (part 17)


In Tetris, we control the movement of the game piece using the keyboard.

There are 4 actions:
move left (left arrow key),
move right (right arrow key),
rotate the game piece (number 5 on the numeric keypad),
drop the game piece (space).

We&#39;ll handle keyboard input in the Tetris class&#39;s run() method.

And now I have two pieces of news for you: good and bad.
The bad news is that Java doesn&#39;t let you read keys
until the user presses enter.
Not very convenient, right?

The good news is that I&#39;ve written a special class (KeyboardObserver) that let&#39;s you get around this limitation.
So you can use it.

There&#39;s also some wonderful news.
You&#39;ve done a great job so far, so I&#39;ll help you a little.
I&#39;ve written the following methods for you:
a) createRandomGamePiece() in GamePieceFactory
b) run() in Tetris

Study them carefully and then proceed.
